Layer Alignment (:mod:`skeleton_keys.layer_alignment`)
========================================================

These functions calculate the layer-aligned depths of morphologies using
layer drawings in the same space.

**NOTE**: These functions are all missing docstrings. They also might be better
located in ``neuron_morphology``
